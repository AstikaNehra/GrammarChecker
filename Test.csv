"At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 .",1
"But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said .",1
"No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however .",1

"The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .",1
"The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .",1
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .,1
"Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .",1
"But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' .",1
"He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' .",1
Salary termed modest,1
Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .,1
"He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility .",1
"The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .",1

"Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. .",1
"`` My feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him .",1
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' .,1
"Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday .",1
"A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff .",1
"`` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this .",1
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .,1
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' .,1
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' .,1

His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous .,1
His bifocals blur .,1

Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth .,1
It is not much better if he meets with old classmates .,1
"Too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by .",1

"Since the obvious is not always true , the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities .",1
"Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more , Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14 .",1
There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election .,1
"These are New York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Maryland , Missouri , New Jersey , Illinois and Minnesota .",1
In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower won all but Missouri .,1
"Yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr. Kennedy .",1
Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia .,1
"Mr. Nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so .",1
"His visit to Warsaw , Poland , after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial .",1
"Yet , the GOP breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called `` Polish '' vote ; ;",1
"30 per cent of the `` Irish '' vote , and 18 per cent of the `` Negro '' vote .",1
A GOP `` task force ' committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities .,1
The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders .,1
These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment .,1
"This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be `` a statistical one '' , and not a reality .",1
The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical .,1
"They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics , which the GOP declared it to be .",1
The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery .,1
"Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing , a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case in point .",1
"If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities .",1
Errors repeated,1
"The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s .",1
"In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover , and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash .",1
"The Republican party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble .",1
Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks `` Hoover carts '' .,1
"Smokers reduced to `` the makings '' , spoke of the sack tobacco as `` Hoover dust '' .",1
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error .,1
But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy .,1
That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business .,1
"The most articulate Republicans are those who , in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy , already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care .",1
"If they also defeat the school bill , the GOP task force won't have much research to do .",1
It will early know why the party won't win back city votes .,1
The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider .,1
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner .,1
"After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative Forum , this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history .",1
"Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions .",1
Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever .,1
And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor's race '' ? ?,1
How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations ? ?,1
"The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months , causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual .",1
"But when former Gov. Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov. Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November , the situation was aggravated .",1
Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation .,1
To have refused would have been political suicide .,1
"And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast aside .",1
The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates .,1
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the `` serious candidates '' .,1
"But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no , and he didn't mince any words .",1
"`` They are just asking too much '' , he said .",1
"We can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either .",1
There are other dangers :,1
Politics is an accelerating game .,1
"`` If an opponent accuses you of lying , don't deny it .",1
"Say he is a horse thief '' , runs an old adage .",1
These men are spenders .,1
"If either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end .",1
"Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths .",1
The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one .,1
Why not have them travel the state in November debating ? ?,1
It would present a forum for them in almost every community .,1
"But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin .",1
There is a way out of this .,1
The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum .,1
It has arranged a campaign for governor .,1
"If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state .",1
But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race .,1
Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a `` great soldier '' .,1

First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested .,1
This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town .,1
The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come .,1
This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither `` to halt an influx of migrants '' nor are we `` setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites '' .,1
What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development .,1
It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs .,1
"Bostitch , Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax .",1
"The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory .",1
The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars .,1
"With our current $3 per hundred tax rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should `` try to develop a modest industrial plant '' as the best way to meet these problems .",1
In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure .,1
As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow .,1
"Mr. Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said : `` If this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain '' .",1
"He went on to say : `` In the first place , industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities .",1
It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be '' .,1
"While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth .",1
"We in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year .",1
It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase .,1

What otherwise could `` the lawyer ,1

With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( AjA version ) and the expandable ( AjB version ) .,1
"This will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony .",1
This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost .,1
"Bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues .",1
"The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults .",1
"They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected .",1
"The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer .",1
"The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired .",1
All panel board comes in standard Af foot size .,1
It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame .,1
The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound .,1
"The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation .",1
There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them .,1
The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade .,1
"The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage .",1
The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .,1
"All nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended .",1
"Note : If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels .",1
Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim .,1
"In any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels .",1
"With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool .",1
"The drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed .",1
"There is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted .",1
The size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column .,1
A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle .,1
A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle .,1
The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .,1
Set-up and maintenance,1
"The drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws .",1
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy .,1
A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; ;,1
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill .,1
Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill .,1
The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush .,1
Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease .,1
Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount .,1
Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ; ;,1
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings .,1
Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position .,1
"The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved .",1
"Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it .",1
Don't lose the chuck key,1
Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; ;,1
"otherwise , you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use .",1
Feeds and speeds,1
Drill speeds are important if you want a good job .,1
"Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked .",1
"On most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys .",1
You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool .,1
See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds .,1
"Generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed .",1
Feed pressure is also of major importance .,1
Too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools .,1
"Too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge .",1
The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate .,1
Common drilling tools,1
There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes .,1
"The most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit .",1
"All will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts .",1
The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade .,1
"Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding .",1
"Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way .",1
Simple hole drilling operations,1
"When drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath .",1
"This will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough .",1
"Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side .",1
"In soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood .",1
"In this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy .",1
"When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark .",1
"The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth .",1
The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects .,1
"For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered .",1
In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection .,1
"The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point .",1
"Its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation .",1
"This document began : `` No. 1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791",1
"`` Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide .",1
"`` We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required '' .",1
"This paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares .",1
A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built .,1
"The matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792 .",1
On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened .,1
"Timothy Palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex , or `` Deer Island '' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs , who received $300 as recompense .",1
"This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy Dwight , president of Yale College , in his `` Travels In New-England And New-York '' , published in New Haven in 1821 .",1
"`` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .",1
The division between the island and this shore ,1
In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge .,1
The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four .,1
I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country .,1
"As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ;",1
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention '' .,1
It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; ;,1
that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; ;,1
"and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody Spofford .",1
"It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia .",1
The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered .,1
"As far as we know , no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792 .",1
Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 .,1
"Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` Massachusetts Magazine '' in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ) .",1
A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber .,1
Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ; ;,1
between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long .,1
"A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island .",1
"It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion .",1
"The `` Essex Journal '' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly Ciceronian '' .",1
The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek ,1
"The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning .",1
It stood in its original form until 1882 .,1
"The southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation .",1
In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge .,1
"This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County , Pennsylvania .",1
Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work .,1
"An advertisement in the `` Newburyport Herald '' , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges .",1
"Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport , Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges .",1
"`` Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it .",1
